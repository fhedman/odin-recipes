        <h3 class="text" id="header-three">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="text list" id="unordered-list">
                <li>1 recipe pickled chanterelles to garnish</li>
                <li>1 lb firm bug damaged chanterelle mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 cup diced yellow onion</li>
                <li>1 cup diced leek white part only</li>
                <li>½ cup diced bread for croutons</li>
                <li>3 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>2 cups of cream</li>
                <li>¼ cup grapeseed canola, or light- taste free olive oil (to be added as the soup is pureed)</li>
                <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>1.5 cups of homemade chicken stock stock plus an additional ½ cup</li>
                <li>A Bouquet garni optional consisting of: 2 fresh bay leaves, 1 small sprig of thyme, and 1 teaspoon of black peppercorns</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="text" id="header-three">Steps</h3>
            <ol class="text list">
                <li>Heat the butter in a deep pot, add the chanterelles and cook, seasoning with a generous pinch of salt to release the juice from the chanterelles and stirring often, until they are fully cooked and have reduced in size by half. Continue cooking the chanterelles until they brown slightly, this deepens their flavor.</li>
                <li>Add the diced onion and leek and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Add the ½ cup of chicken stock and reduce until it is gone (about 5 minutes) and the onions are thoroughly cooked and soft.</li>
                <li>Add the wine and cook for a few minutes, until reduced by half. Add the stock and cream, heat until the mixture comes to a simmer.</li>
                <li>When the mixture simmers, remove the bouquet garni, then puree the soup in a blender, adding equal portions of the grapeseed oil to each batch while pureeing- this adds air, helps it to puree, and improves it's velvety texture. Finally pass the soup through a metal or mesh strainer.</li>
                <li>If you have a vita-mix or industrial blender, you may not need to strain this, and if you just don't feel like straining it, that's ok, just make sure to give it plenty of time on high in the blender, until it is as smooth as you like. Season the soup to taste with salt if needed and then refrigerate immediately.</li>
                <li>To plate, heat the soup, check the seasoning for salt and pepper, then garnish with toasted croutons pickled chanterelles, and the chives.</li>
            </ol>
